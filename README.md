### üìù **Project Description: SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning**

This project presents a basic machine learning implementation for **SMS spam classification**, carried out by **Rishan . N** as part of **Task 4** under the internship program at **Codetech IT Solutions**. The objective is to use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** to distinguish between **legitimate (ham)** messages and **unwanted (spam)** ones.

The project uses a sample dataset created manually for demonstration purposes, eliminating the need for external CSV files. Each message is labeled as either *ham* or *spam*, then processed using the **TF-IDF vectorization technique** to convert raw text into numerical features.

The classifier chosen for this task is **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, which is well-suited for text-based classification problems. The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate the model‚Äôs performance. Key evaluation metrics such as **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report** are included to measure how well the model performs on unseen data.

Additionally, the project includes a section that classifies a few **custom messages**, allowing real-time testing of the trained model. This makes the project interactive, testable, and useful in understanding real-world applications of spam filtering.

This task demonstrates strong foundational skills in **machine learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation**, and **text analytics**, and is an important stepping stone toward developing robust, AI-powered communication filters.
